# Fixor Remediation Progress - Living Roadmap and Status

Snapshot date: 2026-07-09. This file is the cross-session source of truth for what
is done, what is in review, and what is deferred, so no step is silently skipped or
repeated. It is built strictly from the reconciled ledger (`READINESS-FINDINGS.md`),
the audit (`READINESS-AUDIT.md`), and what has actually happened in these sessions.
An open PR is "in review," never "done."

## How we work (guardrails inherited by every session)

- Diagnosis before code. Understand the real code first; do not write a fix until the
  approach is chosen deliberately.
- One step at a time, each one explicitly commanded. If there is no command, stop and
  wait.
- Branch, then PR, then merge by the owner's command. Never the web UI. Never a direct
  commit to protected `main` (it is blocked by the gate anyway).
- No API spend in CI. Live LLM detection is opt-in only and never runs on push.
- Repeated sampling before any HIGH or critical verdict is entered as stable. A single
  LLM sample is not a verdict (the F-008 lesson).
- Every step verified mechanically (process exit codes, API read-backs), not by
  assumption and not by trusting a PASS line in stdout.
- Two gates are kept labeled distinctly: a green deterministic gate proves wiring and
  parsing, not detection quality. Only an opt-in live run verifies model judgment.
- No em dash in human-facing text we author.

## Current readiness verdict

**NOT-READY (temporary).**

The audit (`READINESS-AUDIT.md`) states that items 1 and 2 of its ordered work gate a
clean READY: item 1 was F-001, item 2 is F-004. F-001 is now RESOLVED, so the single
remaining READY-gating blocker is:

- **F-004 - the live-LLM detection brain is only partially guarded by an automated gate.**
  Three detectors (env-exposure, webhook-unverified, and auth-bypass) are now covered by the
  deterministic replay gate; until it also covers the three remaining stage-2 detectors, a
  recall or precision regression in them past the regex prefilters would not be caught by CI.
  Stage 1 is merged (PR #77) and stage 2 sub-steps 2a (env-exposure, PR #79), 2b.0 (shared
  harness, PR #81/#82), 2b.1 (webhook-unverified, PR #83/#84/#85), and 2b.2 (auth-bypass,
  PR #87/#88) are merged, but F-004 is NOT closed: stage 2 sub-steps 2b.3-2b.5 (the three
  remaining detectors) and stage 3 (the opt-in live model-judgment workflow) both remain in
  the deferred worklist.

  Three of six detectors gated is progress, not readiness. Every gate landed so far is a
  wiring-and-parsing gate: none of them verifies detection quality, which is stage 3 (live)
  work that has not started. F-004 stays NOT-READY.

Recall is clean on current evidence (no missed exploit survives re-measurement); the
remaining non-gating items are precision, signal-hygiene, and coverage-integrity
constraints.

## DONE

- **F-001 RESOLVED - PR #75, squash `5e26b00e16d42822b882fe397ff30191fe3f34a6`.**
  Engine B (`runAuditorWorkflow`) now resolves ancestor `_layout` guards over the PR
  head and forwards `sidecarsByPath` into `detect()` at `workflows/auditor-workflow.ts`,
  so a correctly parent-layout-gated route is no longer a HIGH false positive on the
  shipped webhook path. Regression guarded by the committed fixture
  `fixtures/f001-layout-guard/` plus `src/test/test-route-guard-webhook-wiring.ts`
  (deterministic, in `test:ci`) and `src/test/test-f001-webhook-parity.ts` (opt-in live).

- **Branch protection on `main` established and proven real.** It was found ABSENT
  (the branch returned 404 "Branch not protected"), then enforced via the API with:
  required status checks `build + typecheck + tests (20.x)`, `build + typecheck + tests
  (22.x)`, `gitleaks + pattern scan` (strict off); `enforce_admins: true`; required PR
  reviews with approving count 0; no force-push, no deletion. Proven non-bypassable by a
  409 on an attempted direct commit to `main`: "Changes must be made through a pull
  request. 3 of 3 required status checks are expected." (Settings change, no PR/commit.)

- **F-001 ledger reconciliation - PR #76, squash `c7e7cfed35bfc0852db025bab231e8c97a51de00`.**
  Marked F-001 RESOLVED in `READINESS-FINDINGS.md` and reworded the banner from
  DIAGNOSIS-ONLY to REMEDIATION STARTED. Docs only.

- **F-004 stage 1 quick wins MERGED - PR #77, squash
  `e3aa4222b0cf35787730b68e74ecace9394b41f5`.** Exact scope, and only this scope:
  1. Added the already-deterministic, keyless `test:real-shape` to the `test:ci`
     enumeration (route-def reachability coverage, free).
  2. Converted the 15 live-LLM detector tests from hard-fail (`process.exit(1)` or a
     thrown harness error) to a clean skip (exit 0 with a "SKIPPED: no API key" line)
     when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is absent, matching `test:f001-parity`. Key-present
     assertions unchanged.
  3. Fixed the stale `ci.yml` comment that referenced `npm test` and the nonexistent
     `test:xss/cmdi/pt` scripts.
  This does NOT add live detection to CI and does NOT by itself close F-004: it is
  stage 1 of the hybrid; stages 2 and 3 remain in the deferred worklist below.

- **Roadmap first landed - PR #78, squash `a37c766b33ad0e37b2f4a9a08385fddb2491264a`.**
  The initial `REMEDIATION-PROGRESS.md` living roadmap. Documentation only.

- **F-004 stage 2 sub-step 2a MERGED - PR #79, squash
  `f2abd102aa4bdfb4938d07b611ac881674dc6238`.** A deterministic, free replay gate for the
  env-exposure detector. Exact scope:
  1. A record/replay shim (`src/analysis-engine/llm-replay.ts`) wired at the single
     `callClaude` choke point (`anthropic-client.ts`), keyed by a SHA-256 over the
     canonical request shape (model, system, messages, tool). In replay mode it returns
     the recorded response and short-circuits before any client is constructed: no key,
     no network, no spend. A missing or key-drifted fixture fails loud
     (`ReplayFixtureMissing`), never a silent live call.
  2. 17 recorded env-exposure fixtures under `fixtures/replay/env-exposure-multi/`, one
     per LLM-reaching fixture. Recorded once locally on the owner's key at a one-time cost
     of ~$0.133; recording is the only path that spends and never runs in CI.
  3. A dedicated keyless replay round-trip test (`test:replay-env-exposure`) that rebuilds
     each synthetic diff, runs the real detector in replay mode, and asserts
     `flagged === meta.expectedFlagged` per fixture, with a completeness manifest so a
     deleted or renamed recording fails loud rather than silently shrinking coverage.
  4. The shim safety guard test (`test:replay-guard`) proving no-flag `callClaude` stays
     byte-identical to pre-shim behavior.
  Both tests are wired into `test:ci` and were verified running keyless (no key, no
  network) on the GitHub runners for the post-merge commit (node 20.x and 22.x green).
  This is a wiring-and-parsing gate only: it does NOT verify detection quality or model
  behavior, and does NOT by itself close F-004; sub-step 2b and stage 3 remain below.

- **F-004 2a-merged tracker update MERGED - PR #80, squash
  `9f3c2db8234838c9f7a9bc6b81fda1ab152cde6b`.** Documentation only: recorded F-004 stage 2
  sub-step 2a as merged and re-scoped the remaining F-004 work (2b and stage 3).

- **F-004 stage 2 sub-step 2b.0 MERGED - PR #81, squash
  `b83e066b4c52ac39dff89d87f534aeb66f6454d7`.** A test-infrastructure refactor that
  generalizes the stage-2a env-exposure replay gate into a shared, parameterized harness so
  the remaining detectors plug in as specs. Exact scope:
  1. Adds `src/test/replay-harness.ts`: the parameterized engine, with the byte-frozen
     `loadFixture`/`buildSyntheticDiff` moved verbatim from 2a (their exact bytes preserve
     every recorded request key), plus `recordFixtures`, `runReplayGate`, the
     `DetectorReplaySpec`/`Layout`/`OutcomeAssertion` contracts, `positiveNegativeLayout`
     with an optional `loadSidecars` hook for a future idor spec, `flaggedOutcome`, and
     `assertEscalationUnset`.
  2. Adds `src/test/specs/env-exposure.replay-spec.ts`: env-exposure expressed as one spec,
     every 2a value (detector id, the 17-fixture manifest, the expected-flagged map, the
     MEDIUM-ceiling notes, the positive/negative layout) carried over unchanged.
  3. Reduces the two 2a files (`record-env-exposure-fixtures.ts`,
     `test-replay-env-exposure.ts`) to thin delegators over the shared harness
     (net -503/+47 on those two).
  4. Deliberate net-new behavior: `assertEscalationUnset` keeps `FIXOR_ESCALATE_MEDIUM`
     unset inside the harness, hard-stopping the colon-in-callerId Windows footgun (an
     escalation call is tagged `escalation:<detectorId>`, whose colon is an invalid Windows
     path segment for a fixture dir). CI never sets the flag, so all 17 outcomes are
     unchanged.
  This is a test-infrastructure refactor only: it changes no CI, no production code, and no
  detection behavior. The env-exposure gate still reproduces all 17 frozen recordings (11
  positives incl. two MEDIUM-ceiling flagged:false, 6 negatives), confirmed green keyless on
  the GitHub runners for the merge (node 20.x and 22.x). It does NOT by itself close F-004;
  sub-steps 2b.1-2b.5 and stage 3 remain below.

- **F-004 2b.0-merged tracker update MERGED - PR #82, squash
  `f18d43d9094cc73072b8637a0b82d3aee4fe8d6e`.** Documentation only: recorded F-004 stage 2
  sub-step 2b.0 as merged and corrected the status of PR #80. No code, test, or CI change.

- **F-004 stage 2 sub-step 2b.1 (webhook-unverified replay gate) MERGED - three PRs landed
  in order, #83 then #84 then #85.** The second detector to plug into the shared harness,
  taken from structure to an enforced CI guard:
  1. **PR #83, squash `d3b00142df7bd0024818963d0715e98d5e5e3ff0`** - the webhook-unverified
     replay spec plus lane-path support in the shared harness: `verdictLaneOutcome` reads
     the diagnostic verdict off `detector.lastDiagnostics[0].verdict`, an optional
     `expectedLane` per id, and a hardened `loadRecordings`. Structure only; the gate was
     not yet wired and the recordings dir was still empty, so running it failed loud.
  2. **PR #84, squash `b2fd53601b968de3e444f33f3df2df28c167232d`** - the 34 recorded
     fixtures under `fixtures/replay/webhook-unverified-multi/`: 16 HIGH positives, 3
     MEDIUM/review-queue anchors (positive/10 go-github eq-compare, reclassified from a HIGH
     positive to a review-queue anchor alongside negatives 14 and 15 because it verifies the
     HMAC but uses a non-constant-time compare), and 15 not-flagged negatives; plus a
     `.gitattributes` pinning `fixtures/replay/**/*.json` to LF. Recorded once locally on the
     owner's key at a one-time cost of ~$0.248; recording never runs in CI.
  3. **PR #85, squash `456c639fe2091f92fdb6eaa0182c8a6cb25ecb52`** - wired the gate into
     `test:ci` as its final step (a `test:replay-webhook-unverified` script mirroring
     `test:replay-env-exposure`). It runs keyless and offline on both node 20.x and 22.x
     required checks with no workflow YAML change, and `assertEscalationUnset` holds on the
     runners. Verified green keyless on the GitHub runners for the merge.
  Net: the webhook-unverified replay gate is now an enforced CI guard on `main`. Like the
  env-exposure gate it is a wiring-and-parsing gate only (not detection quality), and it
  does NOT by itself close F-004; sub-steps 2b.3-2b.5 and stage 3 remain below.

- **F-004 2b.1-merged tracker update MERGED - PR #86, squash
  `0321755b258f578c3852f9dfb1f5c73eb6bb68b1`.** Documentation only: recorded F-004 stage 2
  sub-step 2b.1 as merged. No code, test, or CI change.

- **F-004 stage 2 sub-step 2b.2 (auth-bypass replay gate) MERGED - two PRs landed in order,
  #87 then #88.** The third detector to plug into the shared harness, taken from recorded
  fixtures to an enforced CI guard:
  1. **PR #87, squash `526841bd1e540874d5e5fc77e0848ac3f894fbe4`** - the auth-bypass replay
     spec (`src/test/specs/auth-bypass.replay-spec.ts`), its recorder, its keyless
     entrypoint, and 37 recorded fixtures under `fixtures/replay/auth-bypass-multi/`.
     The source corpus is 45 files (22 positives + 23 negatives); 37 of them are
     model-reaching and therefore recordable, and 8 negatives are excluded because
     auth-bypass drops them before `callClaude` ever runs:
     - **6 zero-prefilter** (`prefilterRegex` returns 0 hits, so `analyzeFile`
       short-circuits): negatives 02, 03, 08, 09, 10, 19. (Negative/02 also sits on a
       `SKIP_PATH_RE` path, `scripts/dev/`, so it is doubly excluded; it is counted once,
       here.) Negative/19 is a Remix utility module outside `app/routes/`, the direct
       analog of webhook-unverified negative/18.
     - **2 via `SKIP_PATH_RE` at `detect()`** (dropped on path before the prefilter runs):
       negative/05 (`scripts/seed/seed-uploads.js`) and negative/07 (`tests/conftest.py`).
     Recorded one-shot clean, 37/37 against designed intent: all 22 positives flagged
     `isVulnerable:true@high`, all 15 model-reaching negatives not flagged. ZERO cases
     landed off-class, so `EXPECTED_LANE` is empty (`{}`): none of the three not-flagged
     lanes (LOW confidence, MEDIUM review-queue, H7 `laneDeferral`) fired on this corpus.
     Those lane anchors live in `fixtures/real-shape` (exercised by
     `test-auth-bypass-lane.ts`), not here. Recorded once locally on the owner's key at a
     one-time actual cost of $0.31472 (pre-record estimate was $0.27-0.35); recording is
     the only path that spends and never runs in CI.
  2. **PR #88, squash `9285ea6db00d3c5c081b81a4a39b09977cc41031`** - wired
     `test:replay-auth-bypass` into `test:ci` as the final step of the chain, keeping the
     `test:replay-*` group contiguous at the tail (a one-line change; the npm script itself
     already existed from #87). Verified from the GitHub runner job logs, not merely from a
     green check mark, that the gate executes in-chain keyless and offline on both node 20.x
     and 22.x required checks, printing `Mode: replay, offline, no key, no network, no DB.`
     and `recordings cover exactly the 37-fixture manifest`, with `assertEscalationUnset`
     holding on the runners. No workflow YAML change.
  Net: the auth-bypass replay gate is now an enforced CI guard on `main`. Like the
  env-exposure and webhook-unverified gates it is a wiring-and-parsing gate only (not
  detection quality), and it does NOT by itself close F-004; sub-steps 2b.3-2b.5 and stage 3
  remain below.

  **Durable count note (do not re-derive wrongly).** The recordable count for auth-bypass is
  **37, not the ~39 first estimated.** The ~39 over-counted by including negatives 05 and 07,
  which DO trigger the prefilter regex but are dropped on path by `SKIP_PATH_RE` inside
  `detect()` before the model is ever reached. Any count derived from the prefilter alone
  over-includes them. The authoritative number is the 37-entry manifest in
  `auth-bypass.replay-spec.ts`, which the gate asserts for completeness on every CI run.

### IN REVIEW (open PR, awaiting merge command - NOT merged, NOT done)

- **This 2b.2-merged tracker update** is the open docs PR, prepared and awaiting the merge
  command; it is not yet merged and is not listed under DONE until it lands.

---

## NOT-DONE / DEFERRED (ordered worklist)

### Priority 1 - F-004 remaining stages (HIGH; the READY gate)

F-004 is NOT closed until stage 2 (the replay gate) covers the detectors; sub-step 2a
(env-exposure), sub-step 2b.0 (the shared harness), sub-step 2b.1 (webhook-unverified), and
sub-step 2b.2 (auth-bypass) are merged, while sub-steps 2b.3-2b.5 (the three remaining
detectors) are pending. The model-judgment gate (stage 3) is only ever exercised by opt-in
live runs, never free-in-CI.

- **Stage 2 - deterministic replay gate (required, free, in CI).** The replay shim
  (`src/analysis-engine/llm-replay.ts`, wired at the single `callClaude` choke point in
  `anthropic-client.ts`) returns a recorded per-detector response keyed by a hash of the
  request (model, system, messages, tool) instead of calling the network. It guards
  wiring, tool-schema parsing, verdict and lane mapping, and finding emission. It CANNOT
  catch a model-behavior regression (a frozen sample replayed N times is not repeated
  sampling), and is labeled a wiring-and-parsing gate, not a detection-quality gate.
  - **Sub-step 2a (env-exposure): DONE, merged (PR #79).** See DONE above.
  - **Sub-step 2b.0 (harness generalization): DONE, merged (PR #81, tracker #82).** See DONE
    above. The stage-2a gate is now a shared, parameterized harness
    (`src/test/replay-harness.ts`) so the remaining detectors plug in as specs; a
    test-infrastructure refactor only, no detection change.
  - **Sub-step 2b.1 (webhook-unverified): DONE, merged (PR #83/#84/#85).** See DONE above.
    The second detector plugged into the shared harness (spec plus lane-path support, 34
    recorded fixtures, wired into `test:ci`); now an enforced keyless CI guard.
  - **Sub-step 2b.2 (auth-bypass): DONE, merged (PR #87/#88).** See DONE above. The third
    detector plugged into the shared harness (spec, recorder, entrypoint, 37 recorded
    fixtures, wired into `test:ci` as the final chain step); now an enforced keyless CI
    guard. `EXPECTED_LANE` is empty: the corpus produced zero off-class cases.
  - **Sub-steps 2b.3-2b.5 (the three remaining detector specs: 2b.3 admin-check, 2b.4 idor,
    2b.5 secrets-exposure): PENDING.** Repeat the same recorded-fixture pattern per detector.
    The mechanism is now proven end to end on env-exposure, webhook-unverified, and
    auth-bypass and generalizes: the shim, the key derivation, the record harness shape, and
    the keyless round-trip test are all detector-agnostic (2b.0 lifted them into the shared
    harness), so each is largely a repeat per detector (record once on the owner's key, then
    assert `flagged === meta.expectedFlagged` offline, with a lane assertion where a detector
    has a review-queue ceiling, as webhook-unverified did).

    Important: 2b.3 and 2b.5 are NOT plain repeats. Both detectors reach findings on the
    shipped path without calling the model, so a recorded-replay gate is the wrong instrument
    for the deterministic part of their behavior. Known per-detector nuances:
    - **2b.3 admin-check** is a mixed detector. Of its 42-file corpus (21 positives + 21
      negatives), 30 files reach the model, but 9 positives are flagged by a deterministic
      path with NO model call: the per-pattern "Option G" bypass in `admin-check.detector.ts`
      (11 `literal`-tier patterns carry hand-authored explanations and skip `callClaude`
      entirely; the 6 `judgment`-tier patterns such as `role_string_compare` stay on the LLM
      path regardless, because the regex cannot disambiguate bug from safe usage). The
      shipped default is `llmValidation = false` (env `FIXOR_ADMIN_CHECK_LLM_OPT_IN` wins
      over the constructor option). Those 9 deterministic positives need a FREE deterministic
      check, not replay: there is no request to key a recording on. Replay covers only the
      model-reaching remainder. (The 30/9 split comes from the 2b.3 scoping pass and has not
      been re-derived mechanically in this tracker update; the bypass mechanism above is
      confirmed in code. Re-measure before relying on the exact numbers.)
    - **2b.4 idor** needs the `loadSidecars` hook already stubbed into
      `positiveNegativeLayout` (its fixtures carry route/context sidecars), so its spec is
      the one that is not a pure repeat of the no-sidecar detectors. It needs a layout-aware
      recorder, sidecar injection through `loadSidecars`, and a finding-set outcome
      assertion rather than the plain flagged-vs-expected boolean.
    - **2b.5 secrets-exposure** never calls the model on the shipped path: `registry.ts`
      constructs `SecretsExposureDetector()` with no options, so `llmValidation` defaults to
      false and every prefilter hit is flagged regex-only from a hand-authored explanation
      (`preFilterReason: "llm-bypass"`). An LLM path does exist in the class but is opt-in
      (`FIXOR_SECRETS_LLM_OPT_IN=true` or `{ llmValidation: true }`) and is off in CI. So
      guard the shipped behavior with a FREE deterministic regex test, not a replay gate;
      there is no `callClaude` request to record.
      Separately, secrets-exposure carries F-010 (a known false positive on an obvious
      placeholder). Any fixture written for it FREEZES the current behavior as a wiring
      sample only; it does NOT endorse that verdict as correct. Fixing F-010 is separate
      precision work (see Priority 3) and is new work, and when it lands it will move the
      request or the response, so that fixture must then be re-recorded.

- **Stage 3 - opt-in live workflow (manual, spends only when run).** A GitHub Actions
  workflow on `workflow_dispatch` only (NO fork-PR trigger, NO nightly schedule), reading
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from a repo secret the owner sets, running the live detector tests
  through the existing `stability-harness` with repeated sampling (N>=3 and pass
  thresholds) so a single flaky verdict cannot pass as stable. This is the only gate that
  exercises the model's judgment.

### Priority 2 - MEDIUM findings (precision and coverage-integrity)

- **F-002 (MEDIUM) - non-LLM detector throw not counted as degraded coverage.**
  `cli/scan.ts:458-463` (warn and continue); cf. `workflows/auditor-workflow.ts:383-395`.
  A parser or unexpected-input throw yields zero findings for that detector without
  flipping the integrity gate, so a partially-blind run can read as clean.
- **F-003 (MEDIUM) - `readFileSync` failure yields zero findings with no coverage
  signal.** `cli/scan.ts:465-467`. A file that was never analyzed is indistinguishable
  from one analyzed and found clean; exit code and verdict are unaffected.
- **F-006 (MEDIUM) - admin-check false positive on a correctly admin-gated route.**
  `fixor-demo/src/routes/users.ts:8`; `admin-check.detector.ts`. Fires critical on a
  `/:id/promote` route that already performs an explicit admin check.
- **F-009 (MEDIUM) - admin-check false positive / scope drift onto a non-admin GET.**
  `fixor-demo-app-router/app/api/debug/env/route.ts:3`; `admin-check.detector.ts`. Fires
  critical on an env-dump GET that performs no admin operation (already covered by
  env-exposure).
- **F-013 (MEDIUM) - Engine B hint-dependence around the F-001 false positive.**
  `workflows/auditor-workflow.ts:371`; `auth-bypass.detector.ts` SYSTEM_PROMPT case 3/4.
  NOTE: the audit (item 8) ties this to the F-001 fix - the sidecar, not LLM
  convention-guessing, must be the defense. Now that the sidecar is wired (F-001),
  re-measure to confirm whether F-013 is still live or is now moot; do not assume either
  way without a repeated-sample run.

### Priority 3 - LOW findings

- **F-005 (LOW) - org-settings lookup fails open (all findings pass unfiltered).**
  `workflows/auditor-workflow.ts:300-309`. A DB blip silently ignores a customer's
  configured suppressions. Possibly intended; decide posture and surface a visible
  "suppressions not applied" signal rather than passing silently.
- **F-007 (LOW) - cross-detector duplicate criticals on one line (no cross-type merge).**
  `cli/finding-merge.ts` (dedupes by file:line:type, not across types). Confirmed on
  Engine B. Needs a report-boundary merge/priority rule.
- **F-010 (LOW) - secrets-exposure false positive on an obvious placeholder.**
  `fixor-demo-app-router/app/api/config/route.ts:3`; `secrets-exposure.detector.ts`.
  Down-rank self-identifying non-secret values.

### Also deferred - Engine-B empirical coverage gap (audit item 8)

`secrets-exposure`, `env-exposure`, and `webhook-unverified` were exercised on Engine A
only; on Engine B they are inferred-equivalent from shared `detect()` code but not
sampled. Sample them through `runAuditorWorkflow` to convert this to measured parity.

---

## Resolved / Invalid (recorded for transparency; do not carry forward)

- **F-008 - RESOLVED / INVALID (Phase 3C).** Alleged stable anon-IDOR false negative;
  re-measured 12/12 HIGH across both engines. The Phase-3 zero was a transient artifact
  and the stated mechanism was wrong. No defect.
- **F-011 - RESOLVED (Phase 3B).** Corpus gap (no parent-layout-guard instrument); a
  neutral fixture was constructed so F-001 could be measured empirically.
- **F-012 - REFUTED (Phase 3C).** Hypothesized non-determinism on the anon-IDOR verdict;
  Engine A re-run 6/6 HIGH, no zero reproduced. Stable at temperature 0.

---

## Known intentional leftovers (deliberate, not forgotten)

- **`src/test/lib/stability-harness.ts` still throws on a missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  by design.** Its only callers (`test-idor`, `test-idor-tenant`) now skip before
  reaching it (F-004 stage 1), so a keyless run is clean; the throw is deliberately kept
  as a fail-loud safety net for any future direct caller. Not converted to a skip on
  purpose.
