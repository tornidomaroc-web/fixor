# Fixor Remediation Progress - Living Roadmap and Status

Snapshot date: 2026-07-08. This file is the cross-session source of truth for what
is done, what is in review, and what is deferred, so no step is silently skipped or
repeated. It is built strictly from the reconciled ledger (`READINESS-FINDINGS.md`),
the audit (`READINESS-AUDIT.md`), and what has actually happened in these sessions.
An open PR is "in review," never "done."

## How we work (guardrails inherited by every session)

- Diagnosis before code. Understand the real code first; do not write a fix until the
  approach is chosen deliberately.
- One step at a time, each one explicitly commanded. If there is no command, stop and
  wait.
- Branch, then PR, then merge by the owner's command. Never the web UI. Never a direct
  commit to protected `main` (it is blocked by the gate anyway).
- No API spend in CI. Live LLM detection is opt-in only and never runs on push.
- Repeated sampling before any HIGH or critical verdict is entered as stable. A single
  LLM sample is not a verdict (the F-008 lesson).
- Every step verified mechanically (process exit codes, API read-backs), not by
  assumption and not by trusting a PASS line in stdout.
- Two gates are kept labeled distinctly: a green deterministic gate proves wiring and
  parsing, not detection quality. Only an opt-in live run verifies model judgment.
- No em dash in human-facing text we author.

## Current readiness verdict

**NOT-READY (temporary).**

The audit (`READINESS-AUDIT.md`) states that items 1 and 2 of its ordered work gate a
clean READY: item 1 was F-001, item 2 is F-004. F-001 is now RESOLVED, so the single
remaining READY-gating blocker is:

- **F-004 - the live-LLM detection brain is only partially guarded by an automated gate.**
  Two detectors (env-exposure and webhook-unverified) are now covered by the deterministic
  replay gate; until it also covers the four remaining stage-2 detectors, a recall or
  precision regression in them past the regex prefilters would not be caught by CI. Stage 1
  is merged (PR #77) and stage 2 sub-steps 2a (env-exposure, PR #79), 2b.0 (shared harness,
  PR #81/#82), and 2b.1 (webhook-unverified, PR #83/#84/#85) are merged, but F-004 is NOT
  closed: stage 2 sub-steps 2b.2-2b.5 (the four remaining detectors) and stage 3 (the
  opt-in live model-judgment workflow) both remain in the deferred worklist.

Recall is clean on current evidence (no missed exploit survives re-measurement); the
remaining non-gating items are precision, signal-hygiene, and coverage-integrity
constraints.

## DONE

- **F-001 RESOLVED - PR #75, squash `5e26b00e16d42822b882fe397ff30191fe3f34a6`.**
  Engine B (`runAuditorWorkflow`) now resolves ancestor `_layout` guards over the PR
  head and forwards `sidecarsByPath` into `detect()` at `workflows/auditor-workflow.ts`,
  so a correctly parent-layout-gated route is no longer a HIGH false positive on the
  shipped webhook path. Regression guarded by the committed fixture
  `fixtures/f001-layout-guard/` plus `src/test/test-route-guard-webhook-wiring.ts`
  (deterministic, in `test:ci`) and `src/test/test-f001-webhook-parity.ts` (opt-in live).

- **Branch protection on `main` established and proven real.** It was found ABSENT
  (the branch returned 404 "Branch not protected"), then enforced via the API with:
  required status checks `build + typecheck + tests (20.x)`, `build + typecheck + tests
  (22.x)`, `gitleaks + pattern scan` (strict off); `enforce_admins: true`; required PR
  reviews with approving count 0; no force-push, no deletion. Proven non-bypassable by a
  409 on an attempted direct commit to `main`: "Changes must be made through a pull
  request. 3 of 3 required status checks are expected." (Settings change, no PR/commit.)

- **F-001 ledger reconciliation - PR #76, squash `c7e7cfed35bfc0852db025bab231e8c97a51de00`.**
  Marked F-001 RESOLVED in `READINESS-FINDINGS.md` and reworded the banner from
  DIAGNOSIS-ONLY to REMEDIATION STARTED. Docs only.

- **F-004 stage 1 quick wins MERGED - PR #77, squash
  `e3aa4222b0cf35787730b68e74ecace9394b41f5`.** Exact scope, and only this scope:
  1. Added the already-deterministic, keyless `test:real-shape` to the `test:ci`
     enumeration (route-def reachability coverage, free).
  2. Converted the 15 live-LLM detector tests from hard-fail (`process.exit(1)` or a
     thrown harness error) to a clean skip (exit 0 with a "SKIPPED: no API key" line)
     when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is absent, matching `test:f001-parity`. Key-present
     assertions unchanged.
  3. Fixed the stale `ci.yml` comment that referenced `npm test` and the nonexistent
     `test:xss/cmdi/pt` scripts.
  This does NOT add live detection to CI and does NOT by itself close F-004: it is
  stage 1 of the hybrid; stages 2 and 3 remain in the deferred worklist below.

- **Roadmap first landed - PR #78, squash `a37c766b33ad0e37b2f4a9a08385fddb2491264a`.**
  The initial `REMEDIATION-PROGRESS.md` living roadmap. Documentation only.

- **F-004 stage 2 sub-step 2a MERGED - PR #79, squash
  `f2abd102aa4bdfb4938d07b611ac881674dc6238`.** A deterministic, free replay gate for the
  env-exposure detector. Exact scope:
  1. A record/replay shim (`src/analysis-engine/llm-replay.ts`) wired at the single
     `callClaude` choke point (`anthropic-client.ts`), keyed by a SHA-256 over the
     canonical request shape (model, system, messages, tool). In replay mode it returns
     the recorded response and short-circuits before any client is constructed: no key,
     no network, no spend. A missing or key-drifted fixture fails loud
     (`ReplayFixtureMissing`), never a silent live call.
  2. 17 recorded env-exposure fixtures under `fixtures/replay/env-exposure-multi/`, one
     per LLM-reaching fixture. Recorded once locally on the owner's key at a one-time cost
     of ~$0.133; recording is the only path that spends and never runs in CI.
  3. A dedicated keyless replay round-trip test (`test:replay-env-exposure`) that rebuilds
     each synthetic diff, runs the real detector in replay mode, and asserts
     `flagged === meta.expectedFlagged` per fixture, with a completeness manifest so a
     deleted or renamed recording fails loud rather than silently shrinking coverage.
  4. The shim safety guard test (`test:replay-guard`) proving no-flag `callClaude` stays
     byte-identical to pre-shim behavior.
  Both tests are wired into `test:ci` and were verified running keyless (no key, no
  network) on the GitHub runners for the post-merge commit (node 20.x and 22.x green).
  This is a wiring-and-parsing gate only: it does NOT verify detection quality or model
  behavior, and does NOT by itself close F-004; sub-step 2b and stage 3 remain below.

- **F-004 2a-merged tracker update MERGED - PR #80, squash
  `9f3c2db8234838c9f7a9bc6b81fda1ab152cde6b`.** Documentation only: recorded F-004 stage 2
  sub-step 2a as merged and re-scoped the remaining F-004 work (2b and stage 3).

- **F-004 stage 2 sub-step 2b.0 MERGED - PR #81, squash
  `b83e066b4c52ac39dff89d87f534aeb66f6454d7`.** A test-infrastructure refactor that
  generalizes the stage-2a env-exposure replay gate into a shared, parameterized harness so
  the remaining detectors plug in as specs. Exact scope:
  1. Adds `src/test/replay-harness.ts`: the parameterized engine, with the byte-frozen
     `loadFixture`/`buildSyntheticDiff` moved verbatim from 2a (their exact bytes preserve
     every recorded request key), plus `recordFixtures`, `runReplayGate`, the
     `DetectorReplaySpec`/`Layout`/`OutcomeAssertion` contracts, `positiveNegativeLayout`
     with an optional `loadSidecars` hook for a future idor spec, `flaggedOutcome`, and
     `assertEscalationUnset`.
  2. Adds `src/test/specs/env-exposure.replay-spec.ts`: env-exposure expressed as one spec,
     every 2a value (detector id, the 17-fixture manifest, the expected-flagged map, the
     MEDIUM-ceiling notes, the positive/negative layout) carried over unchanged.
  3. Reduces the two 2a files (`record-env-exposure-fixtures.ts`,
     `test-replay-env-exposure.ts`) to thin delegators over the shared harness
     (net -503/+47 on those two).
  4. Deliberate net-new behavior: `assertEscalationUnset` keeps `FIXOR_ESCALATE_MEDIUM`
     unset inside the harness, hard-stopping the colon-in-callerId Windows footgun (an
     escalation call is tagged `escalation:<detectorId>`, whose colon is an invalid Windows
     path segment for a fixture dir). CI never sets the flag, so all 17 outcomes are
     unchanged.
  This is a test-infrastructure refactor only: it changes no CI, no production code, and no
  detection behavior. The env-exposure gate still reproduces all 17 frozen recordings (11
  positives incl. two MEDIUM-ceiling flagged:false, 6 negatives), confirmed green keyless on
  the GitHub runners for the merge (node 20.x and 22.x). It does NOT by itself close F-004;
  sub-steps 2b.1-2b.5 and stage 3 remain below.

- **F-004 2b.0-merged tracker update MERGED - PR #82, squash
  `f18d43d9094cc73072b8637a0b82d3aee4fe8d6e`.** Documentation only: recorded F-004 stage 2
  sub-step 2b.0 as merged and corrected the status of PR #80. No code, test, or CI change.

- **F-004 stage 2 sub-step 2b.1 (webhook-unverified replay gate) MERGED - three PRs landed
  in order, #83 then #84 then #85.** The second detector to plug into the shared harness,
  taken from structure to an enforced CI guard:
  1. **PR #83, squash `d3b00142df7bd0024818963d0715e98d5e5e3ff0`** - the webhook-unverified
     replay spec plus lane-path support in the shared harness: `verdictLaneOutcome` reads
     the diagnostic verdict off `detector.lastDiagnostics[0].verdict`, an optional
     `expectedLane` per id, and a hardened `loadRecordings`. Structure only; the gate was
     not yet wired and the recordings dir was still empty, so running it failed loud.
  2. **PR #84, squash `b2fd53601b968de3e444f33f3df2df28c167232d`** - the 34 recorded
     fixtures under `fixtures/replay/webhook-unverified-multi/`: 16 HIGH positives, 3
     MEDIUM/review-queue anchors (positive/10 go-github eq-compare, reclassified from a HIGH
     positive to a review-queue anchor alongside negatives 14 and 15 because it verifies the
     HMAC but uses a non-constant-time compare), and 15 not-flagged negatives; plus a
     `.gitattributes` pinning `fixtures/replay/**/*.json` to LF. Recorded once locally on the
     owner's key at a one-time cost of ~$0.248; recording never runs in CI.
  3. **PR #85, squash `456c639fe2091f92fdb6eaa0182c8a6cb25ecb52`** - wired the gate into
     `test:ci` as its final step (a `test:replay-webhook-unverified` script mirroring
     `test:replay-env-exposure`). It runs keyless and offline on both node 20.x and 22.x
     required checks with no workflow YAML change, and `assertEscalationUnset` holds on the
     runners. Verified green keyless on the GitHub runners for the merge.
  Net: the webhook-unverified replay gate is now an enforced CI guard on `main`. Like the
  env-exposure gate it is a wiring-and-parsing gate only (not detection quality), and it
  does NOT by itself close F-004; sub-steps 2b.2-2b.5 and stage 3 remain below.

### IN REVIEW (open PR, awaiting merge command - NOT merged, NOT done)

- **This 2b.1-merged tracker update** is the open docs PR, prepared and awaiting the merge
  command; it is not yet merged and is not listed under DONE until it lands.

---

## NOT-DONE / DEFERRED (ordered worklist)

### Priority 1 - F-004 remaining stages (HIGH; the READY gate)

F-004 is NOT closed until stage 2 (the replay gate) covers the detectors; sub-step 2a
(env-exposure), sub-step 2b.0 (the shared harness), and sub-step 2b.1 (webhook-unverified)
are merged, while sub-steps 2b.2-2b.5 (the four remaining detectors) are pending. The
model-judgment gate (stage 3) is only ever exercised by opt-in live runs, never free-in-CI.

- **Stage 2 - deterministic replay gate (required, free, in CI).** The replay shim
  (`src/analysis-engine/llm-replay.ts`, wired at the single `callClaude` choke point in
  `anthropic-client.ts`) returns a recorded per-detector response keyed by a hash of the
  request (model, system, messages, tool) instead of calling the network. It guards
  wiring, tool-schema parsing, verdict and lane mapping, and finding emission. It CANNOT
  catch a model-behavior regression (a frozen sample replayed N times is not repeated
  sampling), and is labeled a wiring-and-parsing gate, not a detection-quality gate.
  - **Sub-step 2a (env-exposure): DONE, merged (PR #79).** See DONE above.
  - **Sub-step 2b.0 (harness generalization): DONE, merged (PR #81, tracker #82).** See DONE
    above. The stage-2a gate is now a shared, parameterized harness
    (`src/test/replay-harness.ts`) so the remaining detectors plug in as specs; a
    test-infrastructure refactor only, no detection change.
  - **Sub-step 2b.1 (webhook-unverified): DONE, merged (PR #83/#84/#85).** See DONE above.
    The second detector plugged into the shared harness (spec plus lane-path support, 34
    recorded fixtures, wired into `test:ci`); now an enforced keyless CI guard.
  - **Sub-steps 2b.2-2b.5 (the four remaining detector specs: 2b.2 auth-bypass, 2b.3
    admin-check, 2b.4 idor, 2b.5 secrets-exposure): PENDING.** Repeat the same
    recorded-fixture pattern per detector. The mechanism is now proven end to end on
    env-exposure and webhook-unverified and generalizes: the shim, the key derivation, the
    record harness shape, and the keyless round-trip test are all detector-agnostic (2b.0
    lifted them into the shared harness), so each is largely a repeat per detector (record
    once on the owner's key, then assert `flagged === meta.expectedFlagged` offline, with a
    lane assertion where a detector has a review-queue ceiling, as webhook-unverified did).
    Known per-detector nuances:
    - **2b.4 idor** needs the `loadSidecars` hook already stubbed into
      `positiveNegativeLayout` (its fixtures carry route/context sidecars), so its spec is
      the one that is not a pure repeat of the no-sidecar detectors.
    - **2b.5 secrets-exposure** carries F-010 (a known false positive on an obvious
      placeholder). Its fixture will FREEZE the current behavior as a wiring sample only; it
      does NOT endorse that verdict as correct. Fixing F-010 is separate precision work (see
      Priority 3), and when it lands it will move the request or the response, so that
      fixture must then be re-recorded.

- **Stage 3 - opt-in live workflow (manual, spends only when run).** A GitHub Actions
  workflow on `workflow_dispatch` only (NO fork-PR trigger, NO nightly schedule), reading
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from a repo secret the owner sets, running the live detector tests
  through the existing `stability-harness` with repeated sampling (N>=3 and pass
  thresholds) so a single flaky verdict cannot pass as stable. This is the only gate that
  exercises the model's judgment.

### Priority 2 - MEDIUM findings (precision and coverage-integrity)

- **F-002 (MEDIUM) - non-LLM detector throw not counted as degraded coverage.**
  `cli/scan.ts:458-463` (warn and continue); cf. `workflows/auditor-workflow.ts:383-395`.
  A parser or unexpected-input throw yields zero findings for that detector without
  flipping the integrity gate, so a partially-blind run can read as clean.
- **F-003 (MEDIUM) - `readFileSync` failure yields zero findings with no coverage
  signal.** `cli/scan.ts:465-467`. A file that was never analyzed is indistinguishable
  from one analyzed and found clean; exit code and verdict are unaffected.
- **F-006 (MEDIUM) - admin-check false positive on a correctly admin-gated route.**
  `fixor-demo/src/routes/users.ts:8`; `admin-check.detector.ts`. Fires critical on a
  `/:id/promote` route that already performs an explicit admin check.
- **F-009 (MEDIUM) - admin-check false positive / scope drift onto a non-admin GET.**
  `fixor-demo-app-router/app/api/debug/env/route.ts:3`; `admin-check.detector.ts`. Fires
  critical on an env-dump GET that performs no admin operation (already covered by
  env-exposure).
- **F-013 (MEDIUM) - Engine B hint-dependence around the F-001 false positive.**
  `workflows/auditor-workflow.ts:371`; `auth-bypass.detector.ts` SYSTEM_PROMPT case 3/4.
  NOTE: the audit (item 8) ties this to the F-001 fix - the sidecar, not LLM
  convention-guessing, must be the defense. Now that the sidecar is wired (F-001),
  re-measure to confirm whether F-013 is still live or is now moot; do not assume either
  way without a repeated-sample run.

### Priority 3 - LOW findings

- **F-005 (LOW) - org-settings lookup fails open (all findings pass unfiltered).**
  `workflows/auditor-workflow.ts:300-309`. A DB blip silently ignores a customer's
  configured suppressions. Possibly intended; decide posture and surface a visible
  "suppressions not applied" signal rather than passing silently.
- **F-007 (LOW) - cross-detector duplicate criticals on one line (no cross-type merge).**
  `cli/finding-merge.ts` (dedupes by file:line:type, not across types). Confirmed on
  Engine B. Needs a report-boundary merge/priority rule.
- **F-010 (LOW) - secrets-exposure false positive on an obvious placeholder.**
  `fixor-demo-app-router/app/api/config/route.ts:3`; `secrets-exposure.detector.ts`.
  Down-rank self-identifying non-secret values.

### Also deferred - Engine-B empirical coverage gap (audit item 8)

`secrets-exposure`, `env-exposure`, and `webhook-unverified` were exercised on Engine A
only; on Engine B they are inferred-equivalent from shared `detect()` code but not
sampled. Sample them through `runAuditorWorkflow` to convert this to measured parity.

---

## Resolved / Invalid (recorded for transparency; do not carry forward)

- **F-008 - RESOLVED / INVALID (Phase 3C).** Alleged stable anon-IDOR false negative;
  re-measured 12/12 HIGH across both engines. The Phase-3 zero was a transient artifact
  and the stated mechanism was wrong. No defect.
- **F-011 - RESOLVED (Phase 3B).** Corpus gap (no parent-layout-guard instrument); a
  neutral fixture was constructed so F-001 could be measured empirically.
- **F-012 - REFUTED (Phase 3C).** Hypothesized non-determinism on the anon-IDOR verdict;
  Engine A re-run 6/6 HIGH, no zero reproduced. Stable at temperature 0.

---

## Known intentional leftovers (deliberate, not forgotten)

- **`src/test/lib/stability-harness.ts` still throws on a missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  by design.** Its only callers (`test-idor`, `test-idor-tenant`) now skip before
  reaching it (F-004 stage 1), so a keyless run is clean; the throw is deliberately kept
  as a fail-loud safety net for any future direct caller. Not converted to a skip on
  purpose.
- **The 15 live-LLM tests remain excluded from `test:ci` on purpose.** Their inclusion is
  gated on the F-004 stages above; they must never run live in CI (no API spend).
